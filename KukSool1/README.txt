Haven't touched this stuff in a long time, so I'm doing some archaeology to try to figure out where I left off.

It looks like the testWords function was trying to match Song against ssahng, and getting pretty close. I don't know why I was trying to do that.

I'd like to maybe make some aliases to the quizzer so that I can actually use the code, even if it's in a strange/intermediate state- the quiz is useful as is.

If I get a chance tonight, I'll take a stab at that.

What would be really nice, is to actually add a gui to it, and start adding media at some point, to make it useful.
